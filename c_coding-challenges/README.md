## Overview

This folder is dedicated to solving different coding problems in C. The goal is to practice and sharpen my skills in algorithmic thinking, data structures, and solving real-world problems using C.

## Challenges

Here are some of the challenges included in this repository:

1. **Grading System**: A program that takes student marks and assigns grades based on predefined ranges.
2. **[Other Challenges]**: [Provide a brief description of other challenges you have worked on.]

## Installation

To run the programs locally, you need to have a C compiler installed, such as **GCC**. Follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/c_coding-challenges.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder containing the C program you want to run:
    ```bash
    cd c_coding-challenges
    ```
3. Compile the C program using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o filename
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./filename
    ```

## Usage

You can explore each challenge and run the corresponding C program for learning purposes or to test solutions to various algorithmic problems.
